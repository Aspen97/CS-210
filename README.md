# CS-210
C++
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project that I have created takes the starting amount of the user's investment and calculates how much the user can save in a month with added compound interest.
The program then totals the amount of savings according to how many years are inputted. 

What did you do particularly well?
I believe one thing I did particularly well was make sure that I created neat, readable code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by adding comments that explain what certain sections of my code are doing. Someone may be able to read what I have, but that doesn't mean that she
would understand how my code is performing a certain action. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I faced many challenges on this project and remember how difficult to write code that processes so much math. I overcame this challenge by writing my code sections at a time and 
verifying that what I wrote initialized before I continued on.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Some skills from this project that will be particularly transferable to other course work would be my ability to create successful if/else statements and loops. These skills
are particularly needed in most programs.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program readable by properly spacing any character from a symbol so that the code isn't smashed together and difficult to read. The code is also adaptable because
the output will change according to the user input.
